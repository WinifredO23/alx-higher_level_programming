How to Use 101-lazy_matrix_mul.py
=============================

This module defines a matrix multiplication function called "lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)" using the NumPy library.

Usage
=====

The function "lazy_matrix_mul" is used to multiply two matrices using NumPy. It takes two parameters:
- m_a (list of lists of ints/floats): The first matrix.
- m_b (list of lists of ints/floats): The second matrix.

The function returns the result of matrix multiplication using NumPy's `np.matmul` function.

Test Cases
==========

Positive Test Cases:

1. Test the multiplication of two valid matrices with integer values.
```python
>>> from 101-lazy_matrix_mul import lazy_matrix_mul
>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
>>> result
[[7, 10], [15, 22]]

    Test the multiplication of two valid matrices with float values.

```python
>>> m_a = [[1.2, 5.5, 6.2], [4.66, 12.3, -9.2]]
>>> m_b = [[5.0, 3.3], [-2.9, 4.4], [7.2, 4.4]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
>>> result
[[34.69, 55.44], [-78.61, 29.018]]

    Test the multiplication of two valid matrices with mixed integer and float values.

```python
>>> m_a = [[1, 2.5], [3.1, 4]]
>>> m_b = [[1.2, 3.3], [4, 2.5]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
>>> result
[[9.2, 9.1], [16.52, 16.05]]

    Test the multiplication of matrices with different sizes that should raise a ValueError exception.

```python
>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)

Negative Test Cases:

    Test the function with inputs that are not lists of lists (e.g., strings or integers).

```python
>>> m_a = "not a list"
>>> m_b = [[1, 2]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)

    Test the function with one of the input matrices being an empty list.

```python
>>> m_a = [[]]
>>> m_b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)

    Test the function with matrices that have different-sized rows (e.g., one matrix with 2 rows and another with 3 rows).

```python
>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)

    Test the function with matrices that cannot be multiplied, such as a 2x3 matrix and a 4x2 matrix.

```python
>>> m_a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> result = lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)

Please note that this function uses NumPy for matrix multiplication, so ensure that NumPy is installed in your Python environment for the code to work correctly.
