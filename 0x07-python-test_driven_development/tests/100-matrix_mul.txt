How to Use 100-matrix_mul.py
=============================

This module defines a matrix multiplication function called "matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)".

Usage
=====

The function "matrix_mul" is used to multiply two matrices. It takes two parameters:
- m_a (list of lists of ints/floats): The first matrix.
- m_b (list of lists of ints/floats): The second matrix.

The function will raise the following exceptions under the specified conditions:
- TypeError: If either m_a or m_b is not a list of lists of ints/floats.
- TypeError: If either m_a or m_b is empty.
- TypeError: If either m_a or m_b has different-sized rows.
- ValueError: If m_a and m_b cannot be multiplied.

The function returns a new matrix representing the multiplication of m_a by m_b.


Test Cases
==========

Positive Test Cases:
1. Test the multiplication of two valid matrices with integer values.
2. Test the multiplication of two valid matrices with float values.
3. Test the multiplication of two valid matrices with mixed integer and float values.
4. Test the multiplication of matrices with different sizes that should raise a ValueError exception.
5. Test the multiplication of two matrices where one of them is a 1x1 matrix.
6. Test the multiplication of two empty matrices to verify that it raises a TypeError exception as documented.

Negative Test Cases:
1. Test the function with inputs that are not lists of lists (e.g., strings or integers).
2. Test the function with one of the input matrices being an empty list.
3. Test the function with matrices that have different-sized rows (e.g., one matrix with 2 rows and another with 3 rows).
4. Test the function with matrices that cannot be multiplied, such as a 2x3 matrix and a 4x2 matrix.
